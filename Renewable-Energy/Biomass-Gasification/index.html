        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The world currently faces a dual crisis: shrinking fossil fuel reserves and a rapidly depleting carbon budget. Despite the availability of renewable resources, billions of tons of agricultural waste are destroyed through field burning annually. This practice contributes to <strong>40% of regional air pollution</strong> and represents a lost energy value of roughly <strong>$50 billion</strong>.</p>

    <section id="solution">
        <h2>The Solution: A New Paradigm in Gasification</h2>
        <p>While traditional gasification has existed since the 1800s, conventional industrial gasifiers are often hindered by their large size, high cost, and issues like tar formation or feedstock blockages.</p>
        <p>Sharma’s research introduces a new construction principle for gasifiers. By inverting the traditional causality chain—viewing the gasification process not as a result of oxygen lack, but as the origin of lower oxygen consumption—designers can implement abundant air inlets to create a larger, more homogeneous reaction zone.</p>

    <section id="performance">
        <h2>Technical Excellence & Performance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compact Prototype:</strong> 150 cm tall unit made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li><strong>High Power Density:</strong> 10 MW/m³; a 5-liter reactor (~size of a small pressure cooker) produces 50 kW thermal output.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatile Feedstock:</strong> Handles wood pellets, straw pellets, and non-pelletized green waste from University sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Can reduce CO₂ emissions by 85% compared to fossil fuel alternatives, promoting a circular economy.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
        <h2>Future Outlook: 24/7 Clean Energy</h2>
        <p>The significance of this technology extends beyond mere waste conversion. The research proposes a <strong>Future Energy Park</strong>—an R&D hub integrating solar concentration and gasification. The system can operate 24/7: utilizing solar energy by day and the high-flow gasifier by night.</p>
        <p>This hybrid approach offers immediate applications for off-grid energy, district heating, and biochar production for carbon sequestration and soil enrichment.</p>
