            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The Bhutanese Physical Society envisions a Bhutan where the understanding of nature through physics serves the well-being of people, the protection of the environment, and the prosperity of future generations.</p>
            <p>Rooted in Bhutan’s cultural values and the principles of Gross National Happiness, the Society seeks to advance physics education, research, and innovation in ways that are ethical, mindful, and aligned with national priorities.</p>
            <p>Through the responsible application of physics—particularly in renewable energy, climate resilience, and sustainable technologies—the Society aspires to support Bhutan’s transition toward a knowledge-based, environmentally harmonious, and self-reliant future, while fostering collaboration between scientists, educators, policymakers, and communities.</p>

        <section id="mission">
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>The mission of the Bhutanese Physical Society is to promote the study, teaching, and application of physics in Bhutan for the benefit of society and the natural environment.</p>
            <p>The Society works to strengthen physics education, support research and innovation, and encourage the responsible use of physics-based technologies—particularly in renewable energy, climate resilience, and sustainable systems.</p>
            <p>Through collaboration with educational institutions, government agencies, industry, and communities, the Society seeks to build national scientific capacity, nurture young physicists, and contribute evidence-based knowledge to national development in a manner consistent with Bhutan’s cultural values and the principles of Gross National Happiness.</p>
