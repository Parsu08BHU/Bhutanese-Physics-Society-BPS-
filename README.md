# Bhutanese-Physics-Society-BPS-
Bhutanese Physics Society is dedicated to promoting physics education, research, and collaboration in Bhutan. We engage students, schools, and researchers through outreach, workshops, and conferences to foster curiosity, learning, and a strong scientific community.

#In addition, the Bhutanese Physics Society plans to organize conferences, workshops, seminars, and summer or winter schools in physics and related fields. These events are intended to bring together local and international experts, create opportunities for scholarly interaction, and expose participants to current advances in physics research and education. Such activities will also help build networks between Bhutanese institutions and the global scientific community.

Through conferences, school outreach, collaborative projects, and open platforms such as GitHub, the Bhutanese Physics Society aspires to cultivate a sustainable and vibrant physics community in Bhutan—one that supports learning, research excellence, and the long-term development of science for societal benefit.
